I have a Riverpod provider created as such:

```
@riverpod
class SelectedEntities extends _$SelectedEntities {
  @override
  Set<FileOfInterest> build(FileType type) {
    return {};
  }

  void add(FileOfInterest entity) {
    if (!state.contains(entity)) {
      state = { ...state, entity};
    }
  }
}
```

I can add to the provider as expected using ref.read, if I do so, the ProviderObserver shows the output as I would expect:

```
flutter: selectedEntitiesProvider(PreviewGrid): {picture.jpg}
```

I have a PreviewGrid which uses ref.watch to look for the data from the provider. If the PreviewGrid has never been opened (I need to click on a button to show it) and I then open it, the provider is showing as empty:

```
flutter: PreviewGrid.build(): {}
```

(from a debugPrint in the build function of the PreviewGrid). If the PreviewGrid is already open though, when I select the file, everything shows up as expected:

```
flutter: selectedEntitiesProvider(PreviewGrid): {picture.jpg} // ProviderObserver output
flutter: PreviewGrid.build(): {picture.jpg}
```

What am I missing, please?:w
