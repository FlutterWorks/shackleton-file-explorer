# Shackleton

Early stages of a File Explorer, designed to manage file metadata where appropriate (images only at this point).

It uses exiftool to manage Metadata and this is required to be installed if you want to edit metadata. At least until
there is a Flutter package to do it in code.

On MacOS, you can use the Meta key to multi-select items in the folder lists, or preview grid. For every other platform
it is the Ctrl key as expected. Why MacOS insists that Ctrl can be used with the left mouse button to simulate a right
click I have no idea. Single Button mice were a bad idea when Steve Jobs insisted on them and who has seen one in the
last 10 years. Seriously Apple?
